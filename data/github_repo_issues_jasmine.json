How about combining the two, just carefully leaving files that don't belong in the gem out of the gemspec? This repo already includes things that aren't part of the core, like the javascript documentation.\nIf part of it is that you plan to have support for other server-side languages in the future, I think having ruby at the root would still be the way to go. That way, if a python implementation got added, a rake task for running the python tasks (including tests) could be added. That way, someone who wanted to maintain consistency among the alternate implementations could easily run tests on both, and someone who's just into python could cd to that directory and build the egg. (Using this scheme, a python implementation of the server-side component could be in a separate repo using submodules, or not. Pythonistas would have to check out jasmine with the submodules to get the javascript code and documentation, and the Python build files would include references to code in the outer repo. For example, if the gem were in python/, it would copy ../src/*.js into its build directory. It would also tell users to get the outer gem if it didn't find it in the parent directory.)\nFinally, something that could be done right away to make things easier: add a homepage on github to jasmine-gem (currently it's empty), so people browsing to it can go straight to the page about jasmine, without scrolling down:\nhttp://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem", "createdAt": "2010-10-05T20:29:07Z", "updatedAt": "2011-01-26T19:43:06Z", "closedAt": "2011-01-26T19:43:06Z", "state": "CLOSED", "closed": true, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "benatkin", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "participants_count": 4, "participants_data": [{"login": "benatkin", "company": "@resourcesco @apicomponents @diodejs "}, {"login": "jfirebaugh", "company": "@figma "}, {"login": "infews", "company": "Infews LLC & Pivotal Labs"}, {"login": "rudylattae", "company": null}], "comments_count": 6, "comments_data": [{"authorLogin": "jfirebaugh", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2010-10-05T22:03:51Z", "contents": "+1\nSplitting the repos sounds like a noble idea in theory, but in practice it simply complicates things for people who want to use or contribute.", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "benatkin", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2010-10-05T23:49:19Z", "contents": "jfirebaugh, I agree, I think it sounds like a noble idea too, and I'm certain that it was done with noble intent.

In a BDD rhythm, most unit tests should be driven by a full-stack test (a la Cucumber) anyway, so the value of calling through to the real method is suspect.\nAs for Ruby's test double frameworks, I've written in the past why they aren't fantastic at facilitating isolated unit testing and when I speak on Jasmine, its superior test double facility is something I frequently point out as an advantage over popular Ruby test double libraries.\n@mcmire - in Java, the most popular test double library is Mockito, and it argues strongly against calling through to the actual component.

Do you know why professional pilots with thousands of hours of experience still train in simulators rather than real airplanes?  Because the simulators allow them to confront conditions that would be prohibitively dangerous, expensive, or difficult to produce in a real airplane.  Same with isolation tests.  You want reality only in the layer between the tests and the mocks, and you want to squeeze that layer as thin as you can get it.  Everywhere else, you want enough complete control to be able to easily introduce unlikely, hard-to-reproduce conditions...so that in production, when those unlikely conditions actually occur, your code will still be operating in tested problem space and its behavior will be as expected.\nI think the ability to call through at all is suspect; making it the default would produce a flood of badly-conceived, low-value, maintenance-heavy tests from Agile beginners who haven't found their sea legs yet.

I find that I mostly would like it if getting access to the return value of some method would make it much easier to test some object.\nFor example: Today I was testing a typeahead widget (a library I don't control) and wanted to attach some code to it to show a spinner while it was fetching data from the net. Now the easiest way to test this was to get access to the jQuery XHR object generated for each request so I could manually reject() or resolve() it to test the stability of my attachment.\nTo do that I had to patch some method quite deep in it's guts to record it's return value and get access to it after a new search was triggered.\nThis resulted in something like this:\n\n        describe(\"searching visualization\", function() {\n\n            beforeEach(function () {\n                this.searchView = this.view.namedSubview('user-search-type-ahead-view')\n                var transport = this.searchView.dataset().transport\n                this.mostRecentXHR = null;\n                var that = this;\n                var originalSendRequest = transport._sendRequest\n                spyOn(transport, '_sendRequest').andCallFake(function() {\n                    var jqXHR = originalSendRequest.apply(this, arguments);\n                    that.mostRecentXHR = jqXHR;\n                    return jqXHR;\n                })\n            })\n\n            it(\"should call a callback when a fetch starts or stops\", function() {\n                spyOn(this.searchView, 'didStartSearch')\n                spyOn(this.searchView, 'didStopSearch')\n                this.changeSearchTerm('fnord')\n                expect(this.searchView.didStartSearch).not.toHaveBeenCalled()\n                jasmine.Clock.tick(300) // actually send the request\n                expect(this.searchView.didStartSearch).toHaveBeenCalled()\n                expect(this.searchView.didStopSearch).not.toHaveBeenCalled()\n                this.mostRecentXHR.reject([])\n                expect(this.searchView.didStopSearch).toHaveBeenCalled()\n            });\n// ....\n\nThe key here is the patch spyOn(transport, '_sendRequest'). which I'm doing purely to get access to it's return value - and it's one off code that doesn't cope well with multiple requests generated for example by multiple datasets which ask different urls.\nThats the sort of situation where it would be much easier if that was just baked in to spyOn().andCallThrough() when I could just check the calls afterwards and get the return values out there.\nI hope that makes it easier for you guys to understand the kind of use cases I would like to use something like this.\nAs an aside: The arguments are already recorded - but not the returned values, while recording them would be easy in the code - I don't quite get what the argument against it should be?

The complexity here is not necessarily in the LoC necessary to implement your feature, but in the behavior. I almost certainly wouldn't want to add some kind of spy interface that sometimes returns values and sometimes not. IE, it's only sensible to ask a spy what return values it has if you're using the andCallThrough strategy. What does it return otherwise? Empty hash? Null? Raise error? What happens if you were using one strategy and then switch to another?\nI could maybe imagine andCallThrough taking a function that then gets called back with the return arguments (this at least has more precedent). To be honest, andCallThrough is vestigial from the way we used to think spies/mocks should be used so I'm reluctant to add behavior to it.

And if you specify andCalThrough() then the real return value should be recorded.\nIf implemented as a callback to andCallThrough() that strikes me as a more special cased implementation that is not as simple to understand - but I'm just as fine with that.\nWhen observing my own unit testing, I would also assert that I'm pretty firmly in the 'test behavior, not interaction' camp of unit testing. Never the less, for certain use cases I like to have the power to easily switch to the 'test interaction' style of unit tests.\nOf course the example above can be implemented differently, and of course a good ajax mocking framework would probably have made it possible to write this test even nicer. But that means having another framework and it doesn't solve the general problem of sensing values that are only available as return values in a method call chain.

(We use MooTools, so that's what the code samples will be in.)\nThe spec in question tests the \"delegateClick\" method of \"myList.\" When an element with the id \"newIndividual_btn\" passes through this method, it fires off an ajax request. When the ajax request successfully completes, $redirect is triggered. Below is a simplified, cut-away view of the class/method we're testing:\nvar myList = new Class({\n\n    delegateClick: function(evt) {\n\n        var self = this;\n        var target = $(evt.target);\n\n        //New Individual\n        if (target.id == 'newIndividual_btn') {\n\n            var submitObj = {\n                 'type': 'individual'\n            };\n\n            var myRequest = new ReqJSON({\n                'url': '/gateway?file=contacts.views&method=newContact',\n                'onSuccess': function(responseJSON) {\n                    $redirect('information?id=' + responseJSON.id);\n                }\n            }).send(JSON.encode(submitObj));\n        }\n     }\n});\n\nAnd here's the skeleton of the spec in question:\n    it (\"calls valid URL\", function() {\n        var spy = spyOn(myList, 'delegateClick');\n        // custom method below that fires a click event on the target element\n        var listener = spy.listen('click', $('newIndividual_btn'));\n        waitsFor(function() {\n            return sinon.dom.url;\n        });  \n        runs(function() {\n            expect(sinon.dom.url).toContain('information?id=');\n        });  \n    });\n\nThere's lots of custom stuff at play here, but the basic mechanism holds true for Jasmine in general: we trigger a condition in preparation for \"waitsFor,\" but Jasmine's \"finishCallback\" fires before \"waitsFor\" completes, and, accordingly, our test runner gets redirected to the new page.", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "mrrena", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2012-04-10T22:28:09Z", "contents": "One last follow-up: we did some more testing, and Jasmine's \"finishCallback\" was NOT the culprit: sorry for the false alarm.\nLogging the calls clearly shows that \"finishCallback\"--without fail--executes only after the \"wait\" and \"waitsFor\" have cleared (my kudos to the team on a job outstanding).\nOur problem turned out to be that we had two of these specs in our runner, one of which only tested to see if the spy was called with a given listener.

But the point is this: you have to set all that up.  Using the provided callback instead, cleans up the test greatly.\nI assume this works by checking the specFunction.length and if that is one, then we assume it's an async spec and refuse to move on until that callback is called (or spec times out of course).

So far so good, but it also calls any callbacks which are added by the inital set of callbacks. This is not so good since it now is impossible to test that multiple callbacks are delayed in the JavaScript event loop instead of calling each other immediately.\nI have code that must not call the callbacks immediately (since calling the callback immediately breaks a guarantee of the code; effectively the callback must not change any variables in the same event cycle). Therefore, the code uses setTimeout(callback1, 0) in order to defer the execution of the callback. The callback may use similar code with similar guarantees. Therefore, it also uses setTimeout(callback2, 0). Unluckily, Jasmine behaves differently for the first callback and for the second.\nThe problem is that in file mock-timeout.js in function jasmine.FakeTimer.prototype.runFunctionsWithinRange\nthe (next to) last line reads\njasmine.FakeTimer.prototype.runFunctionsWithinRange = function(oldMillis, nowMillies) {\n    // ...\n\n        this.runFunctionsWithinRange(oldMillis, nowMillis);\n    }\n}\nThis line runs any newly added functions.

To have THERE be called with 0-4, one way is to create a closure for the function that you are passing to Jasmine, by modifying the for loop as follows:\nfor (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n  console.log(\"HERE\", i); \n\n  it(\"should add for \" + i, (function(i) {\n\n    return function() { checkForSituations(i); };\n\n  })(i));\n\n}\nAs you noted, there wouldn't be a need for a closure if Jasmine executed the function passed immediately. One compelling, albeit simple, reason for the deferred execution is so that Jasmine knows how many specs there are before executing them. This allows for progress formatters that how far you are from having your suite complete.\nThe other side effect of the deferred execution that you noted is that all the \"HERE\"s are grouped together followed by \"THERE\"s. In most cases when writing specs programmatically, it should only matter that the expectations happen with the right arguments (\"THERE\" has 0-4). If interleaving \"HERE\"s and \"THERE\"s is important to your specs, one solution is to put the \"it\" on the outside with the for loop on the inside.\nThis pattern of execution for testing frameworks is not unique to Jasmine, either. Here is approximately the same test in Ruby with RSpec:\ndescribe \"TryTry\" do\n  def checkForSituations(a)\n    puts \"THERE\", a\n    foo(3, a).should == (3 + a)\n  end\n\n  for i in 1..5\n    puts \"HERE\", a\n    it \"should add for #{i}\" do\n      checkForSituations(a)\n    end\n  end\nend\nRunning this outputs the same block of \"HERE\"s and then \"THERE\"s as Jasmine (as well as the closure issue of THERE 5 5 times). In this case, switching the for loop to a Ruby each gets a closure.\nHopefully this explanation clears some things up!", "reactions_count": 1, "reactions_data": ["THUMBS_UP"]}, {"authorLogin": "jianlin", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2013-04-15T06:24:43Z", "contents": "So pretty much, it is because all those functions are added to a list, and then all executed later on, so that's why they all see the same, final i, which is 5.\nI also might consider this form, so that it looks less complicated:\n    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n\n        (function(i) {\n            console.log(\"HERE\", i); \n\n            it(\"should add for \" + i, function() {\n                checkForSituations(i); \n            });\n        }(i));\n\n    }", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "sheelc", "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "createdAt": "2013-04-15T06:32:02Z", "contents": "Yep, that's pretty much it.

Tests ran fine and everything was right. But then a business requirement had me refactor the application so, that it was bootstrapped manually --> unit tests started failing due to full page reload errors.\nI managed to drill down the issue and verify that if I have 19 describe blocks in a test suite, everything runs fine. If I have 20 describe blocks, I get full page reload error.\nI did some console logging, and it seems that the applications run block gets called when the 20th describe block kicks in (this  probably relates to the stack reset). And this run block now executes the cookie/login check with all the redirects and stuff (hence the full page reload).

If this isn't the case, we can talk about having it restore its default in between every spec run.\nYou can also do some syntactic sugar in your boot.js file by adding some code like the following:\njasmineInterface.it.slow = function(desc, func) {\n  var wrappedFn = function(done) { // if you're using 'slow', then you're dealing with an async spec, otherwise there would be no need to call '.slow'\n      var originalJasmineTimeout = jasmine.DEAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL;\n      jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 30;\n      func.call(this, done);\n      jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = originalJasmineTimeout;\n  };\n\n  return jasemineInterface.it(desc, wrappedFn);\n}\nand then in your spec files you could do it.slow('spec about slow async function, waits 30 seconds before failing', function(done) {...});\nHopefully that was helpful.

It's just preemptively assigning a message for the 'not' case. You can see the same thing on Line 35 of that same file in which the correct object was thrown (and the matcher passes), but the message is for the 'not' case yet again.\nThe argument length checking is unrelated to the \"not\" case.

I think isSpecRunning simplifies to what @johnpapa has of\nisSpecRunning = function () { \n  return !!currentSpec; \n};\nbecause the window.mocha || window.jasmine check seems to have been done on line 1917.\nAn alternate option, perhaps for users that don't want to add their own beforeEach/afterEach for spec tracking, is to use the Jasmine reporter interface. Adopted for the angular-mock use case, that would look something like the following:\nisSpecRunning = (function() { // assumes this function is still guarded by 'if(window.jasmine || window.mocha) {'\n  if (window.jasmine) {\n    var specRunning = false;\n    window.jasmine.getEnv().addReporter({\n      specStarted: function() { specRunning = true; },\n      specDone: function() { specRunning = false; }\n    });\n    return function() { return specRunning; };\n  } else {\n    return function() { return !!currentSpec; };\n  }\n})();\nAs a bit of an aside, but something I wanted to clarify since it isn't documented yet: the this being saved off from the beforeEach is not the actual spec object anymore. We had requests that users wanted to use the 'this' to store off their own variables and access them in the 'it' and/or 'afterEach'. So in Jasmine 2.0.0, 'this' is an empty object where users can store their test context without having to worry about conflicting with Jasmine internals. That's why there's no useful properties on the currentSpec.

We're not sure why that check was necessary in angular-mocks.js and removing it should get the code working in both these versions of Jasmine (if cross-compatibility was an issue).\nThe other reason to not add this property back has to do with the second item I mentioned above: the 'this' argument in a beforeEach/it/afterEach is now an empty object for the user to store their own state on and not the actual spec anymore. Adding a queue property and a running state as part of that would conflate with the idea of giving users an empty object that they can then put their own state on.\nGiven that the check should be unnecessary and the 'this' is no longer an appropriate place to put these properties, we hope that other libraries that are depending on it can make the same fix: remove the extra check/use one of the two previously discussed ways of determining if a spec is running. Since the property was never part of the public API, we're hoping that this doesn't actually affect too many other libraries.\nThanks for looping us in on these Jasmine 2.0 compatibility issues with Angular.

So something like the following might work:\njasmine.clock().install(); // might even need to be before jQuery is loaded since it could be closing over setTimeout, etc.\nit(\"fades out the element\", function() {\n  fadeOutElem();\n  jasmine.clock().tick(300);\n  expect($(\".elem\").css('display').toEqual('none');\n});\nThe clock seems like a harder way to test this, but those are all the options I can think of!", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "marcagas", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2014-02-05T05:53:33Z", "contents": "Thanks for your quick response @sheelc, really an effort.

It seems like the arguments check for the call is going down some slow path, it causes the browser to eat up a lot of memory and slows the tests down.\nWhen I perform the arguments check myself it doesn't seem to do this.\nHere is an example:\nit('should receive some event', function() {\n  var mySpy = jasmine.createSpy('mySpy');\n  var model = new Backbone.Model(), anotherModel = new Backbone.Model();\n  model.on('mySpy', mySpy);\n\n  model.trigger('mySpy', anotherModel);\n  //The following toHaveBeenCalledWith is crazy slow...\n  expect(mySpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(anotherModel);\n});\n\nMy fix was to do the following:\nit('should receive some event', function() {\n  var mySpy = jasmine.createSpy('mySpy');\n  var model = new Backbone.Model(), anotherModel = new Backbone.Model();\n  model.on('mySpy', mySpy);\n\n  model.trigger('mySpy', anotherModel);\n  expect(mySpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(jasmine.any(Backbone.Model));\n  expect(mySpy.calls.mostRecent().args[0]).toEqual(anotherModel);\n});\n\nI think the slow path is caused by jasmine.js:2165\nif (util.contains(actual.calls.allArgs(), expectedArgs)) {\n\nSomehow the contains check is recursing in a weird way for backbone models and callbacks at least to cause some serious performance issues.

As a first pass, I swapped out the calls to j$.pp to instead be JSON.stringify and was able to get both ways (toHaveBeenCalledWith and toEqual) running at about the same speed.

The reporter is called with a specDone after done is called, and again after the it returns. This causes a problem for custom reporters, as suiteDone and specDone both get called multiple times. If the spec with the misplaced done is the last spec to be called, suddenly jasmineDone is called, then afterwords specDone, followed by suiteDone, then yet another jasmineDone.\nI would suggest that done() updates a variable in closure scope around the function that contains it and sets the status as done.

There are many large institutions out there using ExtJS.  And they have to deal with Async issues.\nI believe that the Jasmine tool would greatly benefit from offering proper async support.\nClearly the return on investment is great, because the effort to ensure proper async support is a small little footprint in your code base and in the time it would take to implement and document.\nAfter all, why use this tool and have to come up with hacks, when clearly, it could easily be integrated into the tool itself.\nYou can easily have runs/waitsFor and done() within the system available.\nEventually, in a few years, you may decide to phase it out, but for now, there is a real demand for a consistent approach to dealing with Async issues with frameworks such as ExtJS.\nSo, is this issue Closed?

Basically they clear out some lists which trigger some bits of the page to reload which needs waiting for.

Any timers registered during an execution of jasmine.clock().tick() will be run before that execution finishes, if the specified interval is low enough. The result of all that is that the invocation of jasmine.clock().tick() in one spec ends up executing timers registered in another spec even though the mock clock was uninstalled and reinstalled in between.\nI can see a few possible ways to fix this:\n\nChange the behavior of the mock clock so that you have to call jasmine.clock().tick() again to run any timers that were registered during a tick. This would bring the mock clock\u2019s behavior more in line with real setTimeout().\nCreate a new DelayedFunctionScheduler instance each time the clock is installed.\nModify QueueRunner to do a real setTimeout at the end of each async spec.\n\nThe catch is that any solution is a breaking change. That\u2019s sort of the point \u2014 to break specs that shouldn\u2019t be passing but currently aren\u2019t. The first would, I think, be particularly nasty to inflict on users as part of a Jasmine upgrade, even though it might be the right thing to do if we were starting from scratch.

(But hear me out anyway, ha ha.)\nWhile working on a student project, I noticed something about Jasmine which you might consider a \"bug\" which causes unintended DOM interactions between Jasmine's part of the DOM and the app-that's-being-tested's part of the DOM.\nAnd this bug does not have to exist at all; you can painlessly avoid it.\nSo, what is this problem?\nWell, I first noticed a specific case of this bug when I saw some of Jasmine's text appearing in one of the app's divs on a student project I was working on \u2014 the words \"Spec List\" and \"Failures\" appeared on top of what should have been in my app's .menu div. This occurred whenever a specification failed.\nI have reproduced a case of this bug here:\nhttp://codepen.io/prather-mcs/pen/bdVrdN\n(this Pen is loading all necessary Jasmine assets from here)\nWhen you un-comment the test expect(false).toBe(true);, then you will see the bug happen: the app's CSS for .menu is affecting the position of Jasmine's DOM elements that also have class .menu\nI'm sure you want to always keep Jasmine's information down in Jasmine's part of the document.\nSo that's a specific case where .menu is colliding.\nBut I think the general problem you would want to fix is the creation by Jasmine of DOM elements with such commonly-used class-names as these:\n\n.bar\n.menu\n.results\n.summary\n.banner\n\nIn summary, the Issue is this:\nWhile none of Jasmine's CSS rules in jasmine.css change how the app appears, style rules in the tested app which affect any class name that jasmine.css also uses can cause Jasmine's DOM content to be styled in un-intended ways, including causing it to jump right out of Jasmine's part of the page and onto the app's part of the page.\n\nI would be happy to get credit for fixing this bug -- I would go to the jasmine-html.js code that creates DOM Nodes and ensure that all CSS class names are unique (enough) by giving them slightly new names, such as changing code that would add the class .menu to a DOM Node to actually add the class .jasmine-menu instead. Then I would make corresponding changes to jasmine.css as well.\nHowever, I have not contributed to this project before, and have only been looking into the code-base for the first time this week.\nI'm thinking that there are people with seniority and authority who would probably have a better idea of how to name the CSS classes than I have, and they would have a better idea of the best Jasmine app code to write to efficiently implement the fix as well.\nWith that being said, if you would allow me to write a fix and create a Pull request to fix this bug, I would like to get some credit contributing to open source....", "createdAt": "2015-05-05T22:38:04Z", "updatedAt": "2015-05-18T21:28:34Z", "closedAt": "2015-05-18T21:28:34Z", "state": "CLOSED", "closed": true, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "prather-mcs", "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "participants_count": 2, "participants_data": [{"login": "prather-mcs", "company": null}, {"login": "nertzy", "company": "@pivotal and @nertzdyne"}], "comments_count": 3, "comments_data": [{"authorLogin": "nertzy", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2015-05-07T22:08:56Z", "contents": "\ud83d\udc4d to prepending jasmine- to the front of all classes and IDs that are injected into the page.\nI'd encourage you to give it a good try.

So what used to be called .menu should now be called .menu_jasmine-css.\nThe only files I made changes were to:\n\n/src/html/HtmlReporter.js\n/src/html/_HTMLReporter.scss\n/spec/html/HtmlReporterSpec.js\n\n\nI made changes to those places only because, as far as I could tell, Jasmine is well-modularized and the only places I needed to change were these three. I definitely had to read code in other files, because ResultsNodes and QueryStrings were included in these files, and I definitely needed to understand them in order not to break them. I also did project-wide / codebase-wide searches for relevant pieces of code.\nOne of the many mistakes I may have made was not noticing more code that needed to be changed to implement a fix for this Issue.\nTo find each and every place that CSS classes were being created or used in Jasmine, I looked at:\n\nevery CSS rule in the .scss file\nevery usage of  querySelector and querySelectorAll in the codebase\nevery usage of .getAttribute\nevery usage of methods like find that were built on top of querySelector etc...\n\n\nThis is the list of selectors I found which needed to be changed:\n.alert, .banner, .bar, .description, .duration, .empty, .errored, .exceptions, .failed, .failure-list, .failures, .failures-menu, .menu, .messages, .open, .passed, .payload, .pending, .raise, #raise-exceptions, .result, .result-message, .results, .run-options, .skipped, .spec-detail, .spec-list, .spec-list-menu, .specs, .stack-trace, .suite, .suite-detail, .summary, .symbol-summary, .throw, .throw-failures, #throw-failures, .title, .trigger, .version\nThere would be more id name changes to make, except that I had to leave them alone, for reasons I'll write up in another issue.

It has helped me out so much! I love Jasmine's \"this\" keyword. While doing some tests and upgrading from Jasmine version 2.2.1 to 2.3.0, I noticed my tests no longer passed because of a change that was made in the way the \"this\" keyword can be used. I want to understand why this change was made, and if the Jasmine team as well as people using Jasmine would support reverting this change. Take for example the following code:\nbeforeAll(function() {\n    this.attr = 1;\n})\n\ndescribe('Testing root beforeAll', function() {\n    it('should be able to access \"attr\"', function() {\n        expect(this.attr).toEqual(1);\n    });\n});\nNote that in the test we are setting an attribute on the \"this\" keyword inside a beforeAll function that executes on the root level. Executing this test in version 2.2.1 (both the standalone and npm versions) shows the test as passing. However, in version 2.3.0 the test fails.\nLet me explain my argument for why this should be changed to work in the latest version of Jasmine. In Jasmine versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.0 I've noticed that inside any describe block you can access attributes on the \"this\" keyword that were set in the beforeAll function of that describe block, regardless of the nesting level inside the block from which you attempt to access those attributes. It only seems logical that the same rules would apply to beforeAll functions on the root level that set attributes on the \"this\" keyword.\nWhy is this a big deal? Normally you could just use global variables, or put the beforeAll function inside your describe block, and then you could access the attribute just fine. This doesn't work for me though because I chose to use helper files to avoid redundancy in my code. Inside the helper file a beforeAll on the root level initializes attributes on the \"this\" keyword so they can be accessed by the tests. Since the beforeAll no longer works this way, my only alternative (while still allowing me to keep the same testing framework) is using the beforeEach, which will run before every single it block. Considering that there will be over 100 it blocks in my code, the beforeEach will be run dozens of times, making my test code more inefficient. As such, this appears to be a poor solution. So I'm hoping we could get the previous functionality back. :)\nThank you to all who have read my post.

But I'm more asking this as a test to rule things out.\nYou found that running the entire test suite inside of your AMD module works well, but when defining an AMD module within a suite it breaks. Keep in mind that the A in AMD for require.js stands for Asynchronous. The Jasmine specs also say that if you testing asynchronous functions you should be using the done parameter and calling it at the appropriate time.\nPerhaps that will fix your problem?\nMy reasoning for asking how that works, is I moved the AMD define block outside of the actual describe block the test is running in, but not all the way outside of the suite. I am curious to see if this allows the scopes to play nicely or if it performs the same as the initial issue and does not work.", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "slackersoft", "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "createdAt": "2015-07-16T19:08:46Z", "contents": "@hackingbeauty you shouldn't need to actually hold onto the spy object when using spyOn.

After all of your afterEach blocks have been run for a spec, jasmine will put the original function that it replaced inside spyOn back. This doesn't do anything to an external reference to the spy that may have been made while it was installed.

Currently there is no way to spy on the following get functions, because Jasmine currently can only spy on functions that are properties, and not on functions that are set/get accessor functions of a property:\nObject.defineProperty(obj, \"dynamicFoo\", {\n    configurable: true,\n    get: function() {\n        return Math.random();\n    }\n});\n\nvar obj = {\n    get dyanmicBar() { return Math.random(); }\n}\n\nIt seems like the core functionality could be implemented using defineProperty to rewrite the property with a spy for its get or set method.\nThe current code is\nthis.spyOn = function(obj, methodName) {\n    ...\n    var spy = j$.createSpy(methodName, obj[methodName]);\n    obj[methodName] = spy;\n}\n\nThe code could handle accessor functions with a third argument (either \"get\" or \"set\") like so:\nthis.spyOn = function(obj, methodName, accessType) {\n    ...\n    var desc = Object.getPropertyDescriptor(obj, methodName);\n    if(desc[accessType]) { // \"get\" or \"set\" exists on the property\n        var spy = j$.createSpy(methodName, desc[accessType]);  \n\n        desc[accessType] = spy;\n\n        Object.defineProperty(obj, methodName, desc);\n    }\n}\n\nHowever, I'm not sure how this would break existing assumptions. For example, in my sample code above, createSpy is given the property name, but the property is not being spied on; rather, one of the property's accessor functions is being spied on. This change would require eliminating the assumption that a function being spied on is a property of an object, and instead writing logic that admits the possibility that a spied function could be a get or set function within an object property.", "createdAt": "2015-10-16T12:49:53Z", "updatedAt": "2017-12-18T14:06:27Z", "closedAt": "2016-11-04T21:37:29Z", "state": "CLOSED", "closed": true, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "apsillers", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "participants_count": 24, "participants_data": [{"login": "apsillers", "company": null}, {"login": "StanleyGoldman", "company": null}, {"login": "slackersoft", "company": "Pivotal Labs"}, {"login": "mgilliganrca", "company": "Real Capital Analytics"}, {"login": "isadovskiy", "company": null}, {"login": "jamesbrobb", "company": null}, {"login": "apaatsio", "company": null}, {"login": "maxyharr", "company": null}, {"login": "vojtech-cerveny", "company": "CloverDX"}, {"login": "salickc", "company": null}, {"login": "yhari", "company": null}, {"login": "nicbou", "company": "Software developer"}, {"login": "anjmao", "company": "Trackforce"}, {"login": "FunkeyFlo", "company": "Dynamic Products"}, {"login": "benediktarnold", "company": null}, {"login": "chrisatanasian", "company": "@MelianLabs "}, {"login": "ptomato", "company": "@endlessm"}, {"login": "henrahmagix", "company": null}, {"login": "Gigitsu", "company": null}, {"login": "elwynelwyn", "company": null}, {"login": "joshfermin", "company": "Poncho"}, {"login": "fimius23", "company": null}, {"login": "pauljeffreys", "company": "Dominion Enterprises"}, {"login": "phra", "company": "@d0nkeys @BolognaJS "}], "comments_count": 26, "comments_data": [{"authorLogin": "StanleyGoldman", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2015-10-28T01:30:56Z", "contents": "+1", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "slackersoft", "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "createdAt": "2015-10-28T18:37:36Z", "contents": "I can see that being useful.

A solution right now is to do something like b = {'b': true}, but I'd prefer to use createSpyObj.  I'm fine with having to pass an empty array but I'd like to not have to pass a non-empty array.\nI can send out a PR for this if you agree that it'd be a positive change.", "createdAt": "2015-10-30T15:31:44Z", "updatedAt": "2016-10-13T12:07:01Z", "closedAt": "2015-11-02T19:35:32Z", "state": "CLOSED", "closed": true, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "danfinnie", "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "participants_count": 3, "participants_data": [{"login": "danfinnie", "company": null}, {"login": "slackersoft", "company": "Pivotal Labs"}, {"login": "gestj", "company": "Haufe-Lexware GmbH & Co.

These descriptions have very high abstraction level, use words from ubiquitous language (DDD), for example:\nScenario: Wilson posts to his own blog\n  Given I am logged in as Wilson\n  When I try to post to \"Expensive Therapy\"\n  Then I should see \"Your article was published.\"\nAs you can see they don't contain any (javascript) code, so the implementation is independent from the feature description. You can do it on any programming language using any programming style.\nBy running the tests we translate the feature descriptions into running tests by the usage of step definitions. These step definitions are reusable and contain low level code like fixtures, assertions, etc. and they are reusable. So I can say that\nScenario: Gabriel tries to post to Wilson's blog\n  Given I am logged in as Gabriel\n  When I try to post to \"Expensive Therapy\"\n  Then I should see \"You don't have the permissions to post here\"\nAnd I can reuse the step definition of the When I try to post to \"Expensive Therapy\" part.\nA clean separation of these 2 abstraction levels is important not just because the reusability, but because the human readability and the ensurance of  loose coupling between the feature descriptions and the code. So we don't have to touch the feature descriptions if only the implementations changes, but the supported features remain the same.\nOfc. jasmine could be used for writing these step definitions, just as any unit testing framework.", "createdAt": "2015-10-30T20:43:33Z", "updatedAt": "2015-10-31T14:48:19Z", "closedAt": "2015-10-30T20:45:41Z", "state": "CLOSED", "closed": true, "locked": true, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "inf3rno", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "participants_count": 2, "participants_data": [{"login": "inf3rno", "company": null}, {"login": "slackersoft", "company": "Pivotal Labs"}], "comments_count": 4, "comments_data": [{"authorLogin": "slackersoft", "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "createdAt": "2015-10-30T20:45:40Z", "contents": "You are more likely to get quicker responses from the community for \"How to use jasmine?\" questions and a history of other solutions on the jasmine-js group.

I've limited the problem down to the Knockout templates that I'm using, not being loaded for some reason through the SpecRunner. So what I'm doing is loading a Knockout custom component, via a synchronous call to go grab the content:\n<script id=\"Summary\" type=\"text/html\"> \n    <div class='divider'></div>\n    <div class='camera-button'>\n        <div class='camera-circle'></div>\n        <div class='camera-image'></div>\n    </div>\n</script>\n\n<!-- This is the Details Tab for a Card -->\n<script id=\"Details\" type=\"text/html\">\n    <div id=\"details-tab\" class=\"details-tab tab-pane active\" data-bind=\"component: 'instance-table'\"></div>\n</script>\n\n<div data-bind=\"attr: { id: 'detail_' + id() }\">\n    <div class=\"detail-card-container\"></div>    \n        <ul class='nav nav-tabs'>\n            <li data-bind='css: { active: $data.template() === \"Summary\"}'><a data-toggle='tab' data-bind='click: tabClick'>Summary</a></li>\n            <li data-bind='css: { active: $data.template() === \"Details\"}'><a data-toggle='tab' data-bind='click: tabClick'>Details</a></li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <div class='tab-content' data-bind='template: { name: template }'></div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\nSo here the last div with the template binding is causing the problem, taking it out fixes my issue, but doesn't help me produce a correct test.

It also has versioning issues: developers must take extra care to keep the typings file synced with the version of Jasmine they are running.\nThe best way currently available in the TypeScript ecosystem is to publish typings in the npm distribution. See https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Typings-for-npm-packages\nJasmine could do this in one of two ways:\n\nTake ownership of the existing jasmine.d.ts file for each minor version of Jasmine, include that file in the distribution, add a \"typings\" field to the package.json, and also add a test in the release process that ensures that example uses of Jasmine actually type-check.\nProduce typings directly from the sources, by including correct type information in the source code and extracting typescript type definitions from it. The most straightforward way is to rename the sources to .ts, introduce a compilation step in the build, and publish the resulting .d.ts files. Another way worth investigation is to use JSDoc type annotations, and a converter like https://github.com/angular/clutz to extract .d.ts files from these. But in this latter case, you need something that type-checks the JSDoc annotations or they'll have no chance of staying correct. (eg.

I don't know if SauceLabs is maybe running a very slightly newer version of MS Edge than is in the modern.ie VM such that this issue is now fixed in Edge.\nI'd be happy to review anything that seems to be Jasmine directly causing issues, but right now this seems like it is probably a problem in MS Edge itself.\nThanks for using Jasmine!", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "BenoitZugmeyer", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2016-02-29T09:59:07Z", "contents": "Thank you very much for the quick answer.

Given that jasmine has facilities for mocking dates, timers, and Ajax, I feel functionality to mock rAF is appropriate.\nProposed Implementation\nThe rAF should act similarly to the way that set{Timeout,Interval} behave when mocked. Specifically it would be nice if it:\n\nProvided the ability to tick() all queued callbacks at once\nProvided the ability to tick a certain number of callbacks, e.g. tick(n) where n is the first n callbacks\nSupported cancelAnimationFrame\nPerhaps as a nice to have, provided a way to retrieve a copy of the array of scheduled callbacks, e.g. if you wanted to validate that there are not pending callbacks.\n\ndescribe(\"Manually Ticking Jasmine's requestAnimationFrame\", function() {\n  var rafCallback1, rafCallback2;\n\n  beforeEach(function() {\n    jasmine.raf().install();\n    rafCallback1 = jasmine.createSpy('rafCallback1');\n    rafCallback2 = jasmine.createSpy('rafCallback2');\n  });\n\n  afterEach(function() {\n    jasmine.raf().uninstall();\n  });\n\n  it(\"causes all callbacks given within an rAF cycle to be called\", function() {\n    requestAnimationFrame(rafCallback1);\n    requestAnimationFrame(rafCallback2);\n    jasmine.raf().tick();\n    expect(rafCallback1).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(rafCallback2).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  });\n\n  it(\"allows for only a certain number of callbacks to be called\", function() {\n    requestAnimationFrame(rafCallback1);\n    requestAnimationFrame(rafCallback2);\n    jasmine.raf().tick(1);\n    expect(rafCallback1).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(rafCallback2).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n  });\n\n  it(\"supports cancelAnimationFrame\", function() {\n    var frameId = requestAnimationFrame(rafCallback1);\n    requestAnimationFrame(rafCallback2);\n    cancelAnimationFrame(frameId);\n    jasmine.raf().tick();\n    expect(rafCallback1).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(rafCallback2).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  });\n\n  // Nice to have\n  it(\"can provide a read-only queue of pending callbacks?\", function() {\n    requestAnimationFrame(rafCallback1);\n    requestAnimationFrame(rafCallback2);\n    expect(jasmine.raf().pendingQueue().length).toEqual(2);\n    jasmine.tick(1);\n    expect(jasmine.raf().pendingQueue().length).toEqual(1);\n    jasmine.raf().pendingQueue().shift();\n    expect(jasmine.raf().pendingQueue().length).toEqual(1);\n    expect(jasmine.raf().pendingQueue()).toEqual([rafCallback2]);\n  });\n});\nI feel like most of the code used behind the clock functionality could be repurposed for this, and either way I am happy to take point on this and would love to discuss this with the team further.

If I don't pass any custom message, it returns passed.\nFollowing this approach, I was expecting the framework to return something like, for example, Expected true to be true but it seems to be working perfectly fine.\nI believe this would be a great value add to the framework.\n\nUse case where it comes handly\n    var tc1 = it('Should navigate to SomePage', function () {\n        tc1.result.tcName = \"TC1\";\n        tc1.result.tcDesc = \"Verify create button is present\";\n        tc1.result.expectations = [];\n        since('Verify create button is present') // This is how the message is passed.\n        .expect(SomePage.CreateButton.isPresent()).toBe(true);\n    });\n\nThis generates the output as\n\"passedExpectations\": [{\n    \"matcherName\": \"toBe\",\n    \"message\": \"Verify create button is present\",\n    \"stack\": \"\",\n    \"passed\": true\n}]\n\nPretty handy, isn't it?\nNow, If I don't have ability to add custom message, I have to build my own expecation results again by writing each each expecation twice. (2nd time for my own result generation) like\n    var tc1 = it('Should navigate to SomePage', function () {\n        tc1.result.tcName = \"TC1\";\n        tc1.result.tcDesc = \"Verify create button is present\";\n        tc1.result.expectations = [];\n        expect(SomePage.CreateButton.isPresent()).toBe(true); // This will build the native jasmine results object\n        SomePage.CreateButton.isPresent().then(function(isPresent){ // now I have to manually build my own result object\n            tc1.result.expectations.push({\n                title: 'Verify create button is present',\n                status: isPresent ? 'Passed' : 'Failed'\n            })\n        });\n    });\n\nAs you can see, this makes the test cases look dirty. And the logic gets scattered all over the place.\nIt would be great, if all the results logic is at one place and is handled by the framework itself. :)", "createdAt": "2016-06-03T07:57:05Z", "updatedAt": "2016-10-17T19:11:40Z", "closedAt": "2016-10-17T19:11:40Z", "state": "CLOSED", "closed": true, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "adityaparab", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "participants_count": 5, "participants_data": [{"login": "adityaparab", "company": "EPAM Systems"}, {"login": "t2n", "company": null}, {"login": "faredis", "company": null}, {"login": "slackersoft", "company": "Pivotal Labs"}, {"login": "Gerg", "company": null}], "comments_count": 3, "comments_data": [{"authorLogin": "t2n", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2016-07-01T11:43:16Z", "contents": "or maybe extend all the default matchers so that we can do something like expect(elementsFound).toBe(5).because('expected to have 5 elements after doing something')\nso html reporter could provide more feedback on which expectation passed and which not\nI guess people would benefit from such behavior a lot.", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "faredis", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2016-07-14T00:46:44Z", "contents": "This also means the the custom matcher's passed messages are changed to \"Passed.\"\nI would find it useful when working with protractor as a number of the expect statements are testing a number of things  so to make it easier to read we created custom matchers and we would like the  passed messages to appear in the reports so that we can show our customers the tests we have run without  showing them the actual test code.\nSo a customer requirement:\nGiven an admin user\nWhen they log into the website\nthen they have access to the admin page\n\nTranslates to:\ndescribe (\"Given an admin User\", function() {\n  ...\n    it(\"logs into the website\", function(){\n         ...\n         expect(something).toHaveAdminAccess();\n    }\n...\n}\n\ntoHaveAdminAccess will then have a user friendly passed message along the lines of the requirement above that will appear in our reports.\nWhat is odd is that within jasmine the error message is generated in one place and the passed message in another.

My test scenarios heavily reliant with the front end as such my specs are dynamic and loop dependent. Example of what I am doing: in the page there is this called template ( template for a survey ). It is divided into groups and each groups contains questionnaires ( can be multiple-choice, rubric type, or open-ended ). My test involves creating a template, which includes creating the groups and the questionnaires to create a whole template. Then I need to check if the front-end actually displays what I created. I have no problem with creating but my problem is the checking. I am not allowed to do the checking the same time as creating, they must be separate as after creating I need to save it first before I can do the checking. Since, I need to check the questionnaires and groups, I need to loop a lot. So first I need to loop the groups and then loop the questionnaires in each group and then check its question text and question options. So my first it block is to loop the groups it looks like this:\nit( 'Should loop groups', function () {\ngroupPage.getGroups().map( function ( groupEl, groupIndex ) {\n        if ( groupIndex > 0 ) {\n            groupPage.clickGroup( groupIndex );\n        }\n                it( 'Should verify group title for group: ' + groupIndex, function () {\n                        expect( groupPage.getGroupName() ).toEqual( 'Group Name' );\n                }  );\n    } );\n} );\n\nHowever the questionnaires are within the groups, so within the loop group it block, I need to write it blocks for the questionnaires and assert the question texts and option texts. In order to do that, I need to nest the questionnaires it inside the group it. It should look like this.\nit( 'Should verify group titles', function () {\n    groupPage.getGroups().map( function ( group, groupIndex ) {\n        if ( groupIndex > 0 ) {\n            groupPage.clickGroup( groupIndex );\n        }\n                it( 'Should verify group title for group: ' + groupIndex, function () {\n                        expect( groupPage.getGroupName() ).toEqual( 'Group Name' );\n                }  );\n                questionPage.getQuestions().map( function ( question, questionIndex ) {\n                        verifyQuestionText( questionIndex );\n                } );\n    } );\n} );\n\n\nfunction verifyQuestionText( questionIndex ) {\n       it( 'Should verify question text: '  + questionIndex, function () {\n              expect( questionPage.getQuestionText() ).toEqual( 'Question Text' );\n       } );\n}\n\nBut this doesn't work.

At this point, my best guess is that something in the patches is causing the completion callback for the TreeProcessor (https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/blob/master/src/core/Env.js#L254) to be called more than once, and the second time everything has already been cleaned for the top suite.\nIf you need to wait to execute your Jasmine environment, like in the browser-test-shim.js when window.onload() is called, you should make sure that that onload is not getting called when the window loads.", "reactions_count": 1, "reactions_data": ["THUMBS_UP"]}, {"authorLogin": "mikegwhit", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2016-11-30T04:28:09Z", "contents": "Reproduced this behavior via #1237", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "slackersoft", "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "createdAt": "2016-12-01T00:50:12Z", "contents": "See my comment on #1237, multiple execute calls on the same Env isn't really supported by Jasmine.\nIf this is happening during a single run and we can narrow it down to something that Jasmine is doing, we would be happy to get that fixed.", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "eplatzek", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2017-01-10T21:12:12Z", "contents": "+1: Our project started throwing this error when we upgrade from 2.4.1 to 2.5.2.\nIf we run jasmine and remove all the test cases, it still throws the same error.", "reactions_count": 1, "reactions_data": ["THUMBS_UP"]}, {"authorLogin": "slackersoft", "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "createdAt": "2017-02-16T00:55:16Z", "contents": "I still haven't seen an example that fails with just Jasmine and not other patching going on.

If you then try to spyOn(isc.ListGridPlus, 'create') it fails saying create has already been spied upon. This is because ListGridPlus does not provide its own implementation of create and hence spyOn sees the superclass' spy.\nIf you want to be able to differentiate between calls made to isc.ListGrid.create and isc.ListGridPlus.create you'd need to do something like:\nisc.ListGridPlus.create = jasmine.createSpy('ListGridPlus.create');\nHowever, I wanted to be able to use the idiomatic spyOn, so I made the following patch:\nOsirium@ca35330\nWith the patch if spyOn detects the method it's trying to spyOn is already a spy, instead of outright throwing, it tests to see whether the obj.hasOwnProperty(methodName).

Since Jasmine handles this for you, this doesn't seem like a compelling reason for Jasmine to add explicit restore. Other spy/expectation libraries, like expect and sinon, need this feature since they're not integrated with the test execution itself, so the user needs to tell the library when it is safe to clean up spies. If you're migrating from another spy library to Jasmine's built in spies, it should be safe to just delete these restore calls.\nAnother issue centers around the need to change the strategy for the spy, possibly resetting the call counts as well. Using the existing functionality already built into Jasmine seems like it more accurately expresses the intent.\nspyOn(foo, 'bar').and.callThrough();\nfoo.bar.calls.reset();\nfoo.bar.and.returnValue(3);\nor with jasmine.getEnv().allowRespy(true);\nspyOn(foo, 'bar').and.callThrough();\nspyOn(foo, 'bar').and.returnValue(3);\nThe original post for this issue seems like it could be solved similarly with similar clarity arguments, leaving signIn looking something like:\nfunction signIn(done) {\n  foo.bar.calls.reset();\n\n  doStuff();\n\n  expect(foo.bar).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n}\n\nbeforeEach(() => {\n  spyOn(foo, 'bar').and.callThrough();\n});\nIn this case I might also question the assumption that it is valuable to check the call to foo.bar() in every test that needs to execute in a logged in state, as this can cause heavy coupling to the actual implementation of logging a user in in tests that don't need it.\nLooking back at this conversation, it appears I might not have done as well as I had hoped at giving good examples or explaining why I'm asking these questions and suggesting current functionality to solve user's issues. The intent here was never to say that Jasmine will never have this functionality, but that we need to better understand the use case for it to make sure we come up with the right solution. During this discussion of use cases and solutions is not a good time to send in a pull request for the feature, which is why I referred back to this issue and discussion from @UziTech's pull request and left it open pending this discussion.\nI'm happy to revisit this feature, and pull request, with the new understanding about the differences between people aesthetic choices in their test suite and desire for compatibility with other mocking frameworks.\nHopefully this clears up some of the confusion.

Stepping through code (or adding debugger points in tests) shows that tests are being run during this time period -- simply no output is done.\nI've also managed to work around the issue with the following global beforeEach:\nbeforeEach(function(done) {\n  window.setTimeout(function() {\n    done();\n  }, 0);\n});\n\nSince this seems to be an async/sync issue, this may also relate to #1342 and #1241 (especially since the last is what I see on my Karma run if I set the timeout really high: the first test outputs, then all output is buffered until the end of the entire test run when the whole lot is barfed out at once).", "reactions_count": 8, "reactions_data": ["THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP"]}, {"authorLogin": "fluffynuts", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2017-05-09T08:23:19Z", "contents": "Also, we see this behavior on Chrome and PhantomJS.

I'm not aware of any, but that area has been fertile ground for bugs and I can't say for sure that we've gotten it 100% right.\nHere's the basic approach that I would suggest. First the easier stuff that seems to have worked for most people:\n\nUpdate Jasmine to 2.99.x (or 3.x once karma-jasmine releases support for it).\nUpdate Karma, karma-jasmine, and Chrome (if that's what you're using) to the latest versions.\nCheck the run time of your specs and make sure they're all completing in significantly less time than whatever the Karma's browserNoActivityTimeout setting is set to. Also make sure that browserNoActivityTimeout is set to something greater than Jasmine's DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL setting.\n\nIf that doesn't fix it, you've got some digging to do. Here's what I'd suggest doing, in increasing order of difficulty:\n\nLook at each error being logged to the browser console during a test run. Fix as many as possible. For each one that can't be fixed, prove to yourself that the error occurs while the test that causes it is still running, i.e. before the done callback is called or the promise returned from  the test is resolved.\nTry to track down the spec (or smallest possible set of specs) that's causing the problem by disabling blocks of specs using xit/xdescribe until the error goes away. Since these problems can be order-dependent, it can help to disable randomization or set a specific random seed.\nIf you've been able to narrow the problem down to a particular spec, review both the spec and the code under test to make sure that none of your code runs after the spec tells Jasmine that it's done. Pay particular attention to event handlers and callbacks that aren't really relevant to the spec in question but might be running anyway.\nIf you aren't able to narrow it down, review all of your async specs as described in the previous step.\n\nI hope this helps.", "reactions_count": 10, "reactions_data": ["THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP"]}, {"authorLogin": "13it235", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2018-11-20T12:25:30Z", "contents": "just happened to me with chrome 63.0.3239.132 (64 bits) in a small project with 13 specs.

I'm not sure if I'll get an answer here because this is more of a support/conceptual question than an issue. Apologies in advance.\nI'm pretty confused when it comes to receiving messages. Our situation is as follows: we have our own numbers but we're not a mobile service provider. We would like to send messages to our clients (through the actual mobile providers) and be abale to receive answers (Like standardized YES or NO answers or prompts) and act on them through an API. This would be covered by the MO messages you refer to in your architecture:\n\nBut to interconnect with the actual providers they require an SMPP connection where they are the client, while also getting DLRs and everything. This is obviously covered by the \"SMPP Server\" part of your architecture.\n\nThe connection works with the one provider we've tried so far, but every message through that channel gets identified as an MT message...and we have nowhere to forward it because our numbers aren't actual devices. (We get this error:\n\"2017-04-28 19:17:01 ERROR    1 SMPPC [cid:virgin] is not bound: Requeuing ...\"\nSo, to sum it up, is there any way to force messages to be identified as MO (How would they ever be MO and not MT?) to be able to trigger the scripts associated with Receiving SMS-MO as described in your documentation, while at the same time delivering DLRs to the SMPP client. Or if thats impossible, a way to save SMS-MT in a database and respond with DLRs while not actually delivering them to the destination number.\nI hope that wasn't too confusing.

Maybe it could be called createSpyOf(ClassConstructor, ...params).\nThis would make typings in Typescript much easier to write and work with. For an overview of why it's hard to type the current function in an accurate way, see here: microsoft/TypeScript#10571 (comment)\nBy having a constructor as first argument rather than a string, both the mocked type as well as the list of keys being spied on could be inferred just from the parameters, and typescript developers would not need to specify them as generic parameters, which, as you can see from the comment linked above, is annoying for the list of keys being mocked.\nIn order to work with other things besides classes (e.g. typescript interfaces), ideally it would just get as first argument an object with a \"name\" property on it (something like a constructor). This way, we can pass a class constructor, but also anything else that has a name and carries a type.\nThe implementation in the jasmine world is pretty straightforward:\nfunction createSpyOf(constructorLike, params) {\n   return createSpyObj(constructorLike.name, params);\n}\nMy second proposal would be to extend createSpyObj, but I notice from the implementation that it supports a mode of operation in which you only pass one JSON object as first argument and it mocks all its properties.

Before the 2.6 release, Jasmine just replaced the function with one without any explicit arguments. In the 2.6.0 release, we wanted to try to preserve function arity with spies. At first we tried using eval but had at least one (#1325) issue with that. After that, we decided to fall back to just declaring the function with explicit param as you see in 686d815.\nThis likely never really worked well for spies you expect to get things injected into. This also seems a bit like testing the Angular framework and not necessarily your applications code to have a test like that, so I think that writing a wrapper to spyOn you can use to set the $inject property on the spy after it is created it probably the way to go.\nHope this helps.

In particular, it has to be able to assume that core objects provided by the runtime, as well as its own code, have not been modified. There's no way to guarantee any particular behavior in the face of code that replaces things like Function. In this case, Jasmine relies on the presence of Function.prototype.apply to ensure compatibility with browsers that don't provide an apply method on setTimeout and clearTimeout. Jasmine <= 2.6.4 didn't hit that particular code path when running synchronous tests. Jasmine >= 2.7.0 does.\nNormally my advice would be to find a more direct way to assert what your tests really mean, but it looks like your tests really are all about verifying calls to Function. So you might try something like this:\nit('should not call Function', function() {\n  var wasCalled = false;\n  var realFunction = Function;\n  window.Function = function() {\n    wasCalled = true;\n  };\n  \n  try {\n    doSomething();\n  }\n  finally {\n    window.Function = realFunction;\n  }\n  \n  expect(wasCalled).toBe(false);\n});\n\nNote that the the test is synchronous, the mock is installed and removed within the test rather than in beforeEach and afterEach, a hand-rolled mock is used in place of Jasmine spies, and all assertions happen after the real Function is restored. That combination should ensure that no Jasmine code runs while the mock is in place.\nI'd be happy to review a pull request that makes Jasmine more robust in the face of code that modifies the environment.

Using spyOnProperty on existing objects (mocking individual properties) is therefore trickier than mocking individual methods: you need to save a pointer to the actual spy returned because you cannot get it back again to update the plan.\nTwo potential things to fix:\n\n\nMaybe we need to be opening up access to property spies.  I'm not sure exactly how, but maybe if you spy on object.prop (get), we add object.prop_.get to the object?  A non-enumerable new prop?  I suppose nothing is guaranteed to work for ALL code under test, so perhaps a universal getSpy(object, prop/method, [accessType]) is what is missing.\n\n\nIf we fix that, then the original proposal (a list of props) is fine.

The biggest problem is that async is \"contagious\" -- if a function calls an async function and wants to do anything with the result, it has to be async itself. So if matchers are async, then all specs have to be async as well. Which means that implementing this feature would break the majority of Jasmine specs.\nThe other problem is that the feature would be difficult to use correctly. In order for Jasmine to associate the failure with the spec that causes it, it would be necessary to await the expect call so that the spec doesn't finish until after the matcher is evaluated:\nit('throws an error on invalid argument', async () => {\n  await expect(async () => {\n    await methodBeingTested(invalidArgument);\n  }).toThrow(ExpectedError);\n})\n\nThat would be really easy to forget, in which case Jasmine would associate the failure with the wrong spec or no spec at all. We already see that problem when people call done at the wrong time, and it can be incredibly time-consuming to debug.\nSo, to sum up: I recognize the value of this feature, but it would require users to rewrite most existing specs and would make writing Jasmine specs much more error prone.

Thanks for your answer!\nAfter reading all your points above, I came up with an idea. Please, tell me if it could work (and again, forgive me if this is too naive =) ).\nFirst of all, we would need to borrow the idea of cancelable promises described on React's Blog and alter it a bit:\nfunction makeCancelablePromise(originalPromise) {\n  let resolved = false;\n  let hasCanceled = false;\n\n  const wrappedPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    originalPromise.then(val => {\n      resolved = true;\n      (hasCanceled ? reject({ isCanceled: true }) : resolve(val))\n    });\n    originalPromise.catch(error => {\n      resolved = true;\n      (hasCanceled ? reject({ isCanceled: true }) : reject(error))\n    });\n  });\n\n  return {\n    promise: wrappedPromise,\n    cancel() {\n      hasCanceled = true;\n    },\n    isResolved() {\n      return resolved;\n    },\n  };\n}\nOk. Now, the goal is to use expect with async functions without needing to use await before it:\n// `It`'s callback wouldn't need to be async here\nit('throws an error on invalid argument', () => {\n  expect(async () => {\n    await methodBeingTested(invalidArgument);\n  }).toThrow(ExpectedError);\n});\nThe rough idea I came up with goes like this:\nfunction expect(param, ...) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  if (isPromise(param)) {\n      const cancelablePromise = makeCancelablePromise(promise);\n\n      // We will need this to make the parent it wait for all\n      // async expects before exiting\n      parentIt.registerAsyncExpect(cancelablePromise.promise);\n\n      // This will let us abort async expects after the\n      // specified timeout\n      const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {\n          if (!cancelablePromise.isResolved()) {\n            cancelablePromise.cancel();\n          \n            // Fails the expect here telling the user that the \n            // promise was not called before the specified timeout\n            fail(...);\n          }\n      }, jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL);\n  }\n\n  // ...\n}\n\nfunction it(...) {\n\n  // ...\n\n  callTestCallback();\n\n  // Either an async expect will get called or it'll get canceled, so\n  // there's no need to track the async expects timeouts\n  await Promise.all(this.asyncExpects);\n\n  // ...\n}\n\nWhere:\n\nparentIt: the it block where expects get called\nregisterAsyncExpect: a method that would keep track of every async callback passed to expects. In the code above, it is filling the this.asyncExpects array.\n\nOne problem to be worked out is how to abort on a first failure. Maybe listening for a first rejection could work.

I can see a few challenges that might not be immediately obvious:\n\nJasmine can't create promises because it needs to run in environments that don't have them. (And we can't use a polyfill because that could cause users' tests to falsely pass in environments that lack promise support.) So you'd need a purely callback-based equivalent of makeCancelablePromise.\nJasmine would need to support arbitrary numbers of these async expect calls in a given spec, which would add more complexity.\nexpect can't just decide to be async based on the type of the parameter because that would break the behavior of invocations like expect(promiseThatNeverResolves).toEqual(jasmine.any(Promise)). Or imagine a custom matcher like this: expect(somePromise).not.toBeSettled(). Any implementation would need to preserve those behaviors.\nIt seems like this might significantly complicate the code that determines when a spec is done, which is already pretty challenging to work with.\n\nYou are of course welcome to take a crack at this.

I'm seeing some inconsistency in whether or not a global error event is triggered when React catches an exception from a component. In the example above, it is. In the examples I've set up myself, it isn't. I'm not sure if the difference is due to React versions, use of Enzyme, where in the lifecycle the exception is thrown, or something else. In the case where no error event is triggered, there's nothing that Jasmine can do because it has no way of knowing about the error.\nI've had some success with using an error boundary to take control of the behavior, e.g.:\nexport class SpecErrorBoundary extends React.Component {\n   componentDidCatch(error, info) {\n      if (this.props.errorHandler) {\n         this.props.errorHandler(error);\n      } else {\n         // Rethrow from a setTimeout so react can't catch it.\n         // This way it will fail the test suite even if the error\n         // might not be associated with the test that caused it.\n         setTimeout(() => {\n            throw error;\n         });\n      }\n   }\n\n   render() {\n      return this.props.children;\n   }\n}\n\n\nThis can be used to write tests that expect an error to occur, that fail if an error occurs, or (if you really want to) that don't care if an error occurs:\nit('throws an exception', function() {\n   const errorHandler = jasmine.createSpy('errorHandler');\n   mount(\n      <SpecErrorBoundary errorHandler={errorHandler}>\n         <Throws />\n      </SpecErrorBoundary>\n   );\n   expect(errorHandler).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\n      jasmine.objectContaining({message: 'nope!'})\n   );\n});\n\nit('fails the suite if an exception is thrown', function() {\n   mount(\n      <SpecErrorBoundary>\n         <Throws />\n      </SpecErrorBoundary>\n   );\n});\n\nThere are a couple of major issues still: React will log the error to the console even if it's caught by an error boundary, and Enzyme will throw if you try to do anything to the wrapper after the error is caught. I don't believe there's anything Jasmine can do about those issues, and to my way of thinking they seriously limit the usefulness of any test that intentionally causes a component to throw.\nTo cover all the bases around React 16 errors and error boundaries, I think we need three things:\n\nA way to control whether a thrown error fails the test.\nA way to control whether the error is logged to the console.\nA way to inspect the render tree of an error boundary after it catches an error.\n\nI don't think Jasmine itself can or should solve any of those problems. The first is best handled with individual test code, as above. The second is ultimately up to react-dom, and the third seems to be solidly on Enzyme's turf (or on the turf of whatever it is that people use instead of Enzyme).\nFurther discussion and new ideas are welcome but as it is I'm inclined to close this since I don't think there's anything that Jasmine can do to help the situation.", "reactions_count": 1, "reactions_data": ["HEART"]}, {"authorLogin": "the-spyke", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2018-05-14T08:17:03Z", "contents": "Not sure how it works for you.

I feel this functionality would be a useful addition to the spyOnProperty functionality that was released relatively recently.\nExpected Behavior\nWhen writing a test, it should be possible to create a spy object with properties that can be accessed using constructorFunction.property, as you might call constructorFunction.method() on a Jasmine spy object that had been created as follows (from the Jasmine documentation:\nbeforeEach(function() {\n    tape = jasmine.createSpyObj('tape', ['play', 'pause', 'stop', 'rewind']);\n\n    tape.play();\n    tape.pause();\n    tape.rewind(0);\n  });\n\nCurrent Behavior\nAs things stand currently, I have been unable to find another way to create a Jasmine spy object that holds properties as well as methods. This means it is not possible to isolate tests for functions that alter the properties of a different constructor (see below for example).\nPossible Solution\nOne possible implementation that suggests itself to me is to add a second, optional array of properties as key/value pairs when creating a Jasmine spy object. In practice, this would look something like this:\nbeforeEach(function() {\n    tape = jasmine.createSpyObj('tape', ['play', 'pause', 'stop', 'rewind'], ['title': 'Guardians of the Galaxy Awesome Mix: Vol. 1', 'artist': 'Various artists', 'tracks': 12, 'playingTime': 42]);\n\n    tape.play();\n    tape.pause();\n    tape.rewind(0);\n\n    console.log(tape.title); // Guardians of the Galaxy Awesome Mix: Vol. 1 \n  });\n\nSuite that reproduces the behavior (for bugs)\nThis is code to write a simple command-line banking application.\n// account.js\n'use strict';\n\nvar Deposit = require('./deposit.js').Deposit;\nvar Withdrawal = require('./withdrawal.js').Withdrawal;\nconst DEFAULT_BALANCE = 0;\n\nvar Account = function() {\n  this._balance = DEFAULT_BALANCE;\n  this._transactions = [];\n};\n\nObject.defineProperty(Account.prototype, 'balance', {\n  get: function() { return this._balance },\n  set: function(newBalance) { this._balance = newBalance },\n  configurable: true\n});\n\nAccount.prototype.deposit = function(depositAmount) {\n  var deposit = new Deposit(this, depositAmount);\n  deposit.deposit();\n};\n\n// More code\n\n// deposit.js\n'use strict';\n\nvar Deposit = function(account, depositAmount) {\n  this.date = new Date();\n  this.account = account;\n  this.depositAmount = depositAmount;\n};\n\nDeposit.prototype.deposit = function() {\n  var currentBalance = this.account.balance;\n  var newBalance = currentBalance + this.depositAmount;\n  this.account.balance = newBalance;\n};\n\nexports.Deposit = Deposit;\n\n// DepositSpec.js\n'use strict';\n\ndescribe('Deposit', function() {\n  var Account = require('../lib/account.js').Account;\n  var Deposit = require('../lib/deposit.js').Deposit;\n  var account;\n  var deposit;\n\n  beforeEach(function() {\n    account = new Account();\n    deposit = new Deposit(account, 50);\n  })\n\n  describe('Date', function() {\n    it('Should be a date object', function() {\n      expect(deposit.date).toEqual(jasmine.any(Date));\n    });\n  });\n\n  describe('#deposit', function() {\n    it('Should reduce an account\\'s balance', function() {\n      spyOnProperty(account, 'balance', 'get').and.returnValue(0);\n      var balanceSetterSpy = spyOnProperty(account, 'balance', 'set').and.returnValue(50);\n      account.deposit(50);\n      expect(balanceSetterSpy).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    });\n  });\n});\n\nContext\nIn the final test above, it is necessary to create a real account object in order to properly test the functionality of the deposit class, as it modifies the balance property of the account.

Fixing the dummy component to include the \"resizeHandle\" fixed it being undefined and throwing the silent error, which was visible in the browser.\nAlso, it looks like as of v2.0.0  karma-jasmine fixes the obscure error thrown and possibly bubbles up a more useful error for those using an older version of karma-jasmine (like we were).\nHope this helps others find a path to resolving this error!\nCheers \ud83c\udf7a", "reactions_count": 9, "reactions_data": ["THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "HEART", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "HEART"]}], "reactions_count": 34, "reactions_data": ["THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP", "THUMBS_UP"], "labels": ["Karma"], "milestone": null}, {"repo_name": "jasmine/jasmine", "issue_id": 1524, "url": "https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/1524", "title": "beforeAll not working as expected (version 3.1)", "contents": "could be because this option?", "createdAt": "2018-03-07T10:19:46Z", "updatedAt": "2018-03-10T01:38:48Z", "closedAt": "2018-03-10T01:38:48Z", "state": "CLOSED", "closed": true, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "andrew-vdb", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "participants_count": 2, "participants_data": [{"login": "andrew-vdb", "company": null}, {"login": "slackersoft", "company": "Pivotal Labs"}], "comments_count": 1, "comments_data": [{"authorLogin": "slackersoft", "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "createdAt": "2018-03-10T01:38:48Z", "contents": "Jasmine 3.0 changes the default run order to be randomized, so if you have specs that rely on being run in a specific order, you'll need to either make sure you explicitly turn off the randomization, or fix your tests so they don't depend on each other.\nHope this helps.

Without knowing more about your use case, my first reaction is to say that it's probably not something that we want to add. Although your tests might be an exception, my experience is that tests with significant conditional logic tend to be flakier than others.

So it's worth thinking about how many times you'd have to run your tests to get a high enough probability of exercising all the paths you care about. For instance, if there's an equal chance of getting A or B on any given run, then running a test like the one you described twice would give only a 50% chance of exercising both paths. If you have many tests, each of which can independently get either A or B, the problem compounds. In any case you'd end up with a test suite that's probabilistic rather than deterministic: if it's run X times it has a Y% chance of verifying everything that you want it to, where Y is always less than 100.\nThe approach I'd take in your situation is to put the A/B switch under the control of my tests somehow, and then write two tests: One that puts the system into the A state and then verifies the A path, and another that does the same thing with B. That way I could be confident that a single test run had exercised both paths. I realize that setting that up can be extra work when doing end to end testing, which your code sample hints at, but I'd consider it time well spent in most situations.\nIf you do want to stick with the probabilistic approach, I think sticking with simple if statements that have explicit conditions would be clearer than trying to reuse matchers somehow:\nvar url = browser.getCurrentUrl();\nif (url.indexOf('/url1') !== -1) {\n   ...\n} else if (url.indexOf('/url2') !== -1) {\n   ...\n} else {\n   throw new Error('Expected a URL of /url1 or /url2 but got ' + url);\n}\n\nThe virtue of that approach, at least to my eyes, is that the control flow is obvious no matter how much or how little the reader knows about Jasmine.\nI hope this helps.", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "eyecatchup", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2018-09-03T12:58:51Z", "contents": "Another use case where it might be useful:\nit('ALL database GET routes should return their correct status code', function(done) {\n    const async = require('async');\n    const mongoose = require('mongoose');\n    const Route = mongoose.model('Route');\n\n    Route.find({\n        method: 'get'\n    }, function(err, routes) {\n        async.each(routes, function (route, callback) {\n            let statusCode = 200;\n            if (route.statusCode) {\n                statusCode = route.statusCode;\n            }\n\n            request.get(base_url + route.path, function(error, response) {\n                expect(response.statusCode).toBe(statusCode);\n                callback();\n            });\n        }, done);\n    });\n});\nGiven the test above, we can not get the information on which route the expectation fails.

In large projects, you end up bolting on some additional wrappers and test harnesses and the like and that code usually needs testing too.  You need to be able to write a spec like this:\ndescribe('integrationTestHelper', function() {\n    it('fails with jasmine.getEnv().fail if express server cannot start', function() {\n        spyOn(integrationTestHelper, 'startServer').and.throwError();\n        expect(integrationTestHelper(function() { })).toFailWith({\n            pass: false, message: 'Spec aborted, integration environment not ready.'\n        });\n    });\n});\n\nFor some custom frameworks I've worked on, I've seen copied and pasted a matcher to provide this functionality... the important guts are (cringe):\ncompare: function (actual, expectedResult) {\n  var testResults = [];\n  var originalAddExpectationResult = jasmine.Spec.prototype.addExpectationResult;\n  jasmine.Spec.prototype.addExpectationResult = function (...result) {\n      testResults.push(result);\n  };\n\n  actual();\n\n  jasmine.Spec.prototype.addExpectationResult = originalAddExpectationResult;\n\n  if (jasmine.matchersUtil.equals(testResults, expectedResults)) {\n      // ....\n  }\n}\n\nI wonder if something similar could be provided by Jasmine, without the scary prototype monkey patch.", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "slackersoft", "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "createdAt": "2019-05-23T00:36:58Z", "contents": "@elliot-nelson this seems like a different use case than the original poster had in mind.

I'd like to check it inside Spec.execute and if fail-fast is set and hasFailures is true, skip lightly on, like xit does.\nBut sadly, I couldn't figure out how to get access to hasFailures from inside Spec.execute (jasmine.js:620 or so).\nSo I wrote a global accessor and got it that way, checking it at the same place pending and excluded specs are checked:\nif (this.markedPending || excluded === true || $HACK_HAS_FAILURES()) {\n\nand this provided the correct behavior (only report the first failure).\nIf someone can point me in the right direction I'll take another stab at it.\nSuite that reproduces the behavior (for bugs)\nThe above suite reproduces the behavior but I haven't written a meta-spec that would assert that if you pass in the proper command line options and suite, that only one failure is reported.\nContext\nI am teaching a class using test-guided exercises from exercism.io and testfirst.org. In that class it is important that the students work on one feature (spec) at a time, then move on to the next. Seeing a dozen test failures is confusing, especially when they're in random order.\n(As a side issue, IMHO specifying fail-fast should also change the default value of random to false, otherwise you would potentially see a different test failing on each run, which negates the use case of fail-fast to focus on a single failure at a time. I may submit this as a feature request or PR later.)\nYour Environment\n\n\n\nVersion used: 3.1.0 (jasmine-npm and jasmine-core)\n\n\nEnvironment name and version (e.g. Chrome 39, node.js 5.4):\nkombucha-mac:code [ruby 2.3.3p222] alex$ npm -v\n3.10.9\nkombucha-mac:code [ruby 2.3.3p222] alex$ node -v\nv7.2.0\n\n\nOperating System and version (desktop or mobile):\nMacOS High Sierra\n\n\nLink to your project:\nhttps://github.com/alexch/exercism-javascript", "createdAt": "2018-05-25T16:27:22Z", "updatedAt": "2018-05-31T00:34:35Z", "closedAt": "2018-05-31T00:34:35Z", "state": "CLOSED", "closed": true, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "alexch", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "participants_count": 1, "participants_data": [{"login": "alexch", "company": null}], "comments_count": 1, "comments_data": [{"authorLogin": "alexch", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "createdAt": "2018-05-25T17:13:53Z", "contents": "for the record, e15f273 is the commit that added proper fail-fast support and #414 is the issue that requested it -- ditto for jasmine-npm here: jasmine/jasmine-npm@375b7aa and here jasmine/jasmine-npm#16", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}], "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null}, {"repo_name": "jasmine/jasmine", "issue_id": 1564, "url": "https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/1564", "title": "Question: How to use a custom matcher when using toHaveBeenCalledWith", "contents": "The following test-case verifies if the service (which uses Angular HttpClient to do a post request) does indeed use certain headers.\nI want to write some custom matching code to check if the headers contains a certain key and value, like:\nheaders.get('Session') === 'abc'\nMy question is what to write at the ??? in below example?\nspyOn(http, 'post').and.returnValue(new Observable<Response>());\n\nconst result = service.Post<string>(data);\n\nassert.isNotNull(result);\n\nexpect(http.post).toHaveBeenCalledWith(`http://localhost/odata/Employees`, jasmine.any(String),\n    {\n        headers: // ???,\n        observe: 'response'\n    });\n\nIs this possible?", "createdAt": "2018-06-04T06:07:21Z", "updatedAt": "2018-06-13T00:10:02Z", "closedAt": "2018-06-13T00:10:02Z", "state": "CLOSED", "closed": true, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "StefH", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "participants_count": 2, "participants_data": [{"login": "StefH", "company": null}, {"login": "slackersoft", "company": "Pivotal Labs"}], "comments_count": 2, "comments_data": [{"authorLogin": "slackersoft", "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "createdAt": "2018-06-05T00:06:14Z", "contents": "You should be able to use something like the stringMatching asymmetric matcher.

Adding new prototypes would be destroyed with the wrapper. However, now we are back to the point of continuously having to add all the prototype methods which is not ideal.\n\nApproach 3\nThe former can also be solved by simply copying the prototype for non-replace methods.\n    if (!wrapper.prototype) wrapper.prototype = {};\n    if (originalFn && originalFn.prototype) {\n      wrapper.prototype = Object.assign(\n        originalFn.prototype,\n        wrapper.prototype,\n      );\n    }\n\n\nI have done a small quick test:\ntest.js\ndescribe('ClockSpyErrorTest', () => {\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    jasmine.clock().install();\n  });\n\n  afterEach(() => {\n    jasmine.clock().uninstall();\n  });\n\n  it('equals true', () => {\n    spyOn(window, 'Array');\n    spyOn(window, 'Function');\n    expect(true).toBe(true);\n  });\n});\n\nWithout any changes, the test breaks with the following console errors:\njasmine.js:5044 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined\n    at QueueRunner.clearTimeout (jasmine.js:5044)\n    at cleanup (jasmine.js:5058)\n    at jasmine.js:5000\n    at QueueRunner.attempt (jasmine.js:5128)\n    at QueueRunner.run (jasmine.js:5149)\n    at runNext (jasmine.js:5075)\n    at next (jasmine.js:5082)\n    at QueueRunner.onComplete (jasmine.js:5000)\n    at jasmine.js:5165\n    at MessagePort.channel.port1.onmessage (jasmine.js:2317)\nQueueRunner.clearTimeout @ jasmine.js:5044\ncleanup @ jasmine.js:5058\n(anonymous) @ jasmine.js:5000\nattempt @ jasmine.js:5128\nQueueRunner.run @ jasmine.js:5149\nrunNext @ jasmine.js:5075\nnext @ jasmine.js:5082\n(anonymous) @ jasmine.js:5000\n(anonymous) @ jasmine.js:5165\nchannel.port1.onmessage @ jasmine.js:2317\njasmine.js:3007 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined\n    at onerror (jasmine.js:3007)\n\nWith the const Function_prototype = Function.prototype; solution, the test fails with:\nTypeError: Cannot read property 'call' of undefined\n    at <Jasmine>\n    at UserContext.it (file:///Users/nito/Google%20Drive/webapps/jasmine-test/test.js:13:18)\n    at <Jasmine>\n\nAdding  const Array_prototype = Array.prototype; makes the test pass. However, now we need to capture all potential prototype breaks such as:\n\nArray.prototype\nFunction.prototype\nObject.prototype\n\nAdding wrapper.prototype = originalFn.prototype; without any other of the previous changes also makes the tests pass. As well as any other of the other approaches suggested here.\nAdditionally, all the 3 approaches here passes all the tests using grunt.\n@slackersoft Would you be willing to approve any of these changes?", "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": []}, {"authorLogin": "slackersoft", "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "createdAt": "2018-10-10T00:35:24Z", "contents": "My inclination for this is to add some helper methods to Jasmine's util object (slice and join) that wrap up the Array prototype stuff and reduce some of that groping out from the various places in Jasmine's codebase.

It looks like you're using Angular and Karma to run your Jasmine suite, and based on the initial error message with $injector, probably angular-mocks or something similar. My best guess based on what I see here is that something in your test setup is causing one of those things to break and when Jasmine tries to format the error message one of the objects in the tree provides it's own toString() function (or possibly jasmineToString()) and the object returned by that isn't fully a String in that it doesn't have a substring function on it.\nFor now, you're probably going to have to dig into your tests and figure out what is causing the original error, but I would be happy to review a pull request for Jasmine that allowed it to cope with toString or jasmineToString functions that return objects that don't appear to be strings.\nHope this helps.

The stopping condition was removed to simplify the example. Note that You are going to have to increase the timeout durations to reproduce the results.\nYou - as developers and/or seasoned users of Jasmine - may already know what happens when this spec is executed: Chrome runs out of memory at around 2gb at i = 31*106, the browser tab crashes and the test fails silently, i.e. no warnings or errors are logged to the console.\nThe cause for the memory \"leak\" is likely that Jasmine creates a result object for every single expectation that passed. This hypothesis is based on the fact that monkey-patching Spec::addExpectationResult fixes the memory \"leak\":\nspec.addExpectationResult = (pass, ...args) => {\n  if( ! pass )\n    Object.getPrototypeOf(spec).addExpectationResult.call(spec, pass, ...args)\n}\nFor someone like me, who's new to Jasmine however, this memory \"leak\" is terribly confusing. I realize that this is not an actual leak since keeping track of passed results is intended. The out-of-memory error without feedback however is likely not intentional.\nWhich brings me to the following suggestions:\n\nCould a warning be emitted when Spec::result.passedExpectations exceeds a threshold, say 106?\nIdeally said warning would point to a setting that allows one to drop passed expectations from the spec.

Tick must be called after the timeout is set, which may be set in an async context and inaccessible from the unit test.\nPossible Solution\nReplace the tick() line with this:\nPromise.resolve().then(() => Promise.resolve()).then(() => jasmine.clock().tick(30000));\nOr, mark the function provided to it() as async and replace the subscribe( line with:\nawait await myFuntion().subscribe(\nAlternately, as mentioned by the other issues and StackOverflow post, override Promise to be synchronous, or save off the original setTimeout() function before installing jasmine clock. Perhaps Jasmine could:\n\noffer an option to make Promises synchronous\nmention that Promises are asynchronous in the jasmine.clock() documentation\nperhaps when jasmine.clock() is installed, that could be a reference time, so if it was ticked forward, it would then trigger any timeouts that should've been triggered, even if those timeouts were set after the jasmine.clock().tick() call.\nperhaps a new method like jasmine.clock().tick(300).withAsyncLevels(3) that would result in the code\n\n        Promise.resolve().then(() => {\n            Promise.resolve().then(() => {\n                Promise.resolve().then(() => {\n                    jasmine.clock().tick(30000);\n                });\n            });\n        });\nContext\nI spent multiple days trying to figure out why my code appeared to be ceasing execution in the chain of promises and observables I was attempting to test, eventually narrowing it down to an issue between interactions of Promise + Jasmine + Observable timeout operator. Then learning that jasmine.clock().tick() won't trigger timeouts that haven't been set yet, Promises are defined to be always async, and Observables may be async or sync depending on how they're used.\nYour Environment\n\n\nVersion used: 2.99.1\nEnvironment name and version (e.g. Chrome 39, node.js 5.4): Chrome 72\nOperating System and version (desktop or mobile): macOS", "createdAt": "2019-02-28T15:50:13Z", "updatedAt": "2019-05-31T00:30:13Z", "closedAt": "2019-05-31T00:30:12Z", "state": "CLOSED", "closed": true, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "chrisjdev", "authorAssociation": "NONE", "participants_count": 2, "participants_data": [{"login": "chrisjdev", "company": null}, {"login": "slackersoft", "company": "Pivotal Labs"}], "comments_count": 9, "comments_data": [{"authorLogin": "slackersoft", "authorAssociation": "MEMBER", "createdAt": "2019-03-14T00:29:44Z", "contents": "Promises resolving asynchronously is even more complicated than you indicate here. Most promise libraries actually use a few other tricks to do asynchronous callbacks for resolution and rejection with less overhead that setTimeout(fn, 0).\nIf I'm understanding you correctly, I think Jasmine actually does do some of the things that you suggest. If you schedule a setTimeout during a tick, the callback for that setTimeout should be executed before tick returns. There is a caveat on setTimeout(fn, 0) if that occurs on the last millisecond of the current tick, but you should be able to work around that by ticking for an extra one. An example:\ndescribe('timeouts', function() {\n  beforeEach(() => { jasmine.clock().install() });\n  afterEach(() => { jasmine.clock().uninstall() });\n\n  it('does some stuff', function() {\n    var thing1 = jasmine.createSpy('thing1');\n    var thing2 = jasmine.createSpy('thing2');\n\n    thing1.and.callFake(() => setTimeout(thing2, 0));\n    setTimeout(thing1, 0);\n\n    expect(thing1).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(thing2).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n\n    jasmine.clock().tick(0);\n\n    expect(thing1).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(thing2).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  });\n});\nThis fails because thing2 isn't called. But\ndescribe('timeouts', function() {\n  beforeEach(() => { jasmine.clock().install() });\n  afterEach(() => { jasmine.clock().uninstall() });\n\n  it('does some stuff', function() {\n    var thing1 = jasmine.createSpy('thing1');\n    var thing2 = jasmine.createSpy('thing2');\n\n    thing1.and.callFake(() => setTimeout(thing2, 0));\n    setTimeout(thing1, 0);\n\n    expect(thing1).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(thing2).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n\n    jasmine.clock().tick(1);\n\n    expect(thing1).toHaveBeenCalled();\n    expect(thing2).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  });\n});\nThis passes. This functionality is the current defined functionality for the Jasmine clock (we even have a comment denoting):\n              // checking first if we're out of time prevents setTimeout(0)\n              // scheduled in a funcToRun from forcing an extra iteration\nThe reasoning for this seems to me to be so you can tick and check the side effects from the first callback without having any subsequent callbacks run. I could also see allowing an option to tick to proceed through any setTimeout(0)s that occurred, but I wouldn't want to make this the default functionality right now.\nHope this helps.

I hadn't considered behavior with setTimeout(0). I still believe that having to tick the clock forward after any Promises resolve async requires too much knowledge of the code under test, and of how Jasmine works.

The following are all equivalent, with varying levels of expressiveness:\nspyOn(foo, 'bar');\nspyOn(foo, 'bar').and.stub();\nspyOn(foo, 'bar').and.returnValue(undefined);\n\nPossible Solution\nI'm fishing here.  Obviously, there are one billion jasmine tests out there that assume an un-configured spy returns undefined, so you can't break that.\nI think there's a few things I'd like that add up to a workable solution:\n\nA new spy strategy (or maybe it's a method on spy itself?) that explicitly says \"expect this not to be called\".  spy.and.unexpected() or something.  You can already do this!  But it's unintuitive:\n\n// One approach that's already built in...\nspy.withArgs('aosdfihasidfhsido').and.returnValue();\nspy();  // => throws error\n\n// Obviously, you can also do this...\nspy.and.callFake(myCustomUnexpectedCallHandler);\nspy();  // => throws some custom error\n\n\nSome way (perhaps temporarily?) to \"default\" what method is used when assigning spies.  Especially for mass-assignment... This might be good enough:\n\n// This could mean \"apply the unexpected spy strategy to every spy?\"\nspyOnAllFunctions(request).and.unexpected();\n\n// Or without a new spy strategy\nspyOnAllFunctions(request).and.throwError(UnexpectedError);\n\nContext\nThis is something that I end up implementing on many projects, and so it'd be great if there was a built-in \"jasmine\" way to accomplish it.\n(The use case here is when you are unit testing modules and completely mocking external dependencies.  It's very useful to grab the 3 components this component uses, and mass-assign every function on all of them an error that says \"hey, this got called unexpectedly!\".  You then allow-list only the expected function calls by assigning .stub() or .callThrough() as appropriate.)\nThis could be related to #1641, in that, I'm kind of advocating for a message like this (with no withArgs):\n\nUnexpected call to 'spy' with arguments [blah]\n\nWhereas the linked issue wants to fix the toBeCalledWith matcher, you could make that argument about the withArgs output, and desire:\n\nUnexpected call to 'spy' with arguments [blah]. You might have meant:\n\n\n#1: diff builder comparison of withArgs(0) & blah\n#2: diff builder comparison of withArgs(1) & blah\netc.\n\nSo, the behavior I'm looking for is consistent, just the message is more detailed if you've used withArgs().\nYour Environment\n\nnode v6, v8, v10 (varies)", "createdAt": "2019-05-05T23:15:49Z", "updatedAt": "2019-06-07T11:18:32Z", "closedAt": null, "state": "OPEN", "closed": false, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "elliot-nelson", "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "participants_count": 2, "participants_data": [{"login": "elliot-nelson", "company": "HBO"}, {"login": "slackersoft", "company": "Pivotal Labs"}], "comments_count": 8, "comments_data": [{"authorLogin": "elliot-nelson", "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "createdAt": "2019-05-06T15:14:22Z", "contents": "I guess it's worth mentioning that this suggestion is similar  to #1568.\nMy suggestion is to make it easy to have all methods on a module blow up immediately if they get used.

Variants 1-4 all happen \"inside\" a running spec context; Variants 5-7 would be outside a running spec but in a suite context, so we'd need to detect that and behave differently if we cared to support it.\nProposed Behavior\nMy understanding of how skip() should work is that it should immediately exit the current function, and any follow-up functions at that level.  It should still execute any functions at any level above this level.\nLevel        Function Containing skip()\n-----        --------------------------\n0            beforeAll\n1              beforeEach\n2                beforeEach\n3                  it\n2                afterEach\n1              afterEach\n0            afterAll\n\nExpressed as requirements:\n\nIf skip() is encountered inside it, skip the rest of this it.  All afterEach's defined must be called in order as usual.\nIf skip() is encountered inside a beforeEach, skip the rest of that beforeEach, skip the it we were about to execute, and skip the same-level corresponding afterEach.  All afterEach defined above this level must still execute -- for example, a skip encountered in Level 2 will skip Level 2's afterEach but not Level 1's.\nIf skip() is encountered inside a afterEach, skip the rest of that function, but nothing else.\nIf skip() is encountered inside a beforeAll, I'm not sure what should happen.  Either literally no tests at all should run (i.e. report NOTHING), or, we should run everything but every single beforeEach, it, and afterEach is skipped.  The afterAll is also skipped in this case.\n\nRelationship with pending()\nThere are similarities between pending() and skip().  I think the skip interface should make it intentional that Jasmine will never for any reason attempt to run the skipped content, and that it is well-suited for:\n\nBroken code (potentially unrunnable)\nUnsafe code (code with side effects that could break other tests)\nSlow tests (i.e. a large suite with tests that are all timing out due to an error)\nIntermittent tests (sometimes pass, sometimes fail)\n\nThe intention for pending(), I believe, is tests that are fundamentally sound but are just not passing yet, which is not the same category as the situations above.\nChanges to Reporting API + Packaged Reporters\nTODO: Decide whether we need to and can report \"skipped\" and \"pending\" tests separately to reporters, update the reporting API, and update packaged reporters to display this information.  Determine whether we can make this a non-breaking change (ideally, outdated custom reports simply take a new field -- skipped -- that they don't display until they are updated).\nChanges to shortcut (xit/xdescribe) functions\nTODO: Is it appropriate to change xit/xdescribe to \"skip\" instead of \"pending\"?\nComparisons to other popular projects: Mocha just copies Jasmine, so xit translates to pending.  RSpec interprets xit/xdescribe as skipped, NOT pending, so we could align with them in Jasmine if desired.\nNew helper shortcuts\nSpeaking of RSpec, note that they provide the it \"replacements\" skip and pending (so skip(\"blah\", function() { instead of it()) to easily mark tests as skipped or pending.  \"skip()\" is identical to \"xit()\" for RSpec.  These might be alternative, better approaches than supporting Variants 5-7 up above.  However, this would increase the additions to global scope.\nApproach\nSorry for the essay.  I'd like to see this functionality, and want to make sure it's laid out for anyone who might want to tackle it.

Unfortunately both of them return an object, and we can't break that API, so my suggestion is:\nspyOnAllFunctions(widget, and => and.throwError('Do not call me'));\n\ncreateSpyObj('widget', ['a', 'b'], and => and.returnValue('Hello!'));\n\nBoth functions would add a final optional parameter, a \"spy strateger setter\".  If specified, it will be called for each spy created, allowing introspection e.g.:\nspyOnAllFunctions(widget, and => and.returnValue(`You called ${and.identity}.`));\n\nFor the createSpyObj case, the spy strategy would take precedent over the default values provided in object form:\nvar obj = createSpyObj({ f: 3, g: 4 }, and => and.returnValue(7));\nexpect(obj.f()).toEqual(7);\n\nBut, they would still be initially set as a base:\nvar obj = createSpyObj({ f: 3, g: 4 }, and => {\n    // Advanced usage\n    and.getSpy().withArgs(jasmine.any(Number)).and.callFake(x => x * 2);\n});\n\nexpect(obj.f(10)).toEqual(20);\nexpect(obj.f()).toEqual(3);\n\nThis \"spy strategy setter\" implementation would mimic the syntax in #1716, so it would be consistent.\nPOTENTIAL DOWNSIDES\nThis might further fragment the ways in which to use createSpyObj... e.g., including properties:\nvar foo = createSpyObj('foo', ['f', 'g'], ['x', 'y'], and => and.throwError('No Good'));\n\nfoo.x           // => throws error\nfoo.x = 3;    // => throws error\n\nALTERNATIVES\nThere's been discussion before (#1692) about a way to retrieve spies with some kind of jasmine.getSpies call, e.g.:\nspyOnAllFunctions(widget);\njasmine.getSpies(widget).and.throwError('You called me');\n\nThis might be a better way forward, because the getSpies function would be a brand new interface that could potentially have some options (you could specify whether to include methods, properties, etc., something like):\nvar widget = jasmine.createSpyObj('widget', ['a', 'b', 'c'], ['x', 'y']);\n\n// Update the spy strategy for the functions & prop getters, but not prop setters\njasmine.getSpies(widget, { fn: true, get: true, set: false }).and.throwError('You called me');", "createdAt": "2019-06-26T11:50:27Z", "updatedAt": "2019-06-26T11:52:52Z", "closedAt": null, "state": "OPEN", "closed": false, "locked": false, "activeLockReason": null, "authorLogin": "elliot-nelson", "authorAssociation": "CONTRIBUTOR", "participants_count": 1, "participants_data": [{"login": "elliot-nelson", "company": "HBO"}], "comments_count": 0, "comments_data": [], "reactions_count": 0, "reactions_data": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null}, {"repo_name": "jasmine/jasmine", "issue_id": 1725, "url": "https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine/issues/1725", "title": "Proposal: await jasmine.clock().asyncTick()", "contents": "Several previous issues have discussed the way mock clock doesn't work very well with Promises #1659 #1282 #710 . Here I have a proposal for a new method on the mock clock that will inter-operate with Promises nicely.\nIt's quite common to write code like this:\nasync function() {\n  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\n  console.log('A');\n  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));\n  console.log('B');\n}\n\nYou might expect jasmine.clock().tick(2000) to log both A and B, but it will log neither A nor B! The issue is that .tick() runs any scheduled timeouts one after the other, synchronously, and doesn't allow microtasks to run.\nInstead, we need to run a timeout, wait for microtasks to run, and then run the remaining timeouts, repeat. This is pretty close to the way the JS engine actually works.\nI propose adding an .asyncTick() method that does what I've just described. The test would call it like this:\nawait jasmine.clock().asyncTick(2000);\n\nOne difficulty is knowing how to wait for microtasks to run. In previous issues, people pointed out that various Promise implementations work in different ways. My solution to this (in other settings) has been to schedule a (real) setTimeout. This does slow the test down, but it's a lot better than using a real clock.\nAnother alternative could be to call jasmine's clearStack(). If a user has a Promise implementation that is slower than whatever clearStack() does, we could just not care. (They can always get a better Promise implementation!) This would be my preferred approach.\nIf this seems like a reasonable proposal, I will try to code it up and send a PR.
